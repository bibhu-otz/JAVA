# Understanding Java I/O Fundamentals

## Introduction
Java I/O (Input/Output) is a crucial part of programming in Java, allowing developers to read from and write to data sources such as files, console, and network connections. This document provides a comprehensive overview of Java I/O fundamentals, covering key concepts, mechanisms, and the essential classes involved.

---

## 1. What is I/O in Java?
- **I/O Operations**: These refer to the methods used to receive data from input sources and send data to output destinations.
- **Purpose**: I/O operations are vital for data processing, allowing applications to interact with users and other systems.
  
---

## 2. Overview of Input/Output Streams
- **Streams**: A stream is a sequence of data elements made available over time.
- **Input Stream**: A stream that delivers data to a program (e.g., reading data from a file).
- **Output Stream**: A stream that sends data from a program (e.g., writing data to a file).

### Stream Types
- **Byte Streams**: Handle raw binary data, allowing for more efficient handling of binary files (e.g., images, audio).
- **Character Streams**: Handle character data, supporting text processing and enabling the use of various character encodings.

---

## 3. Input and Output Mechanisms in Java
- Java provides mechanisms for:
  - **Reading data** from files, keyboard input, or network sockets.
  - **Writing data** to files, displaying output to the console, or sending data over the network.

### Input/Output Flow

| Class Hierarchy       | InputStream, OutputStream     | Reader, Writer                   |
| Encoding              | No encoding support           | Supports character encoding       |
| Use Cases             | Images, audio files           | Text files                       |

## 5. The java.io Package

- The java.io package provides classes for system input and output through data streams, serialization, and the file system.

- Key Classes:
  
  - `File:` Represents files and directory pathnames.
  - `FileInputStream:` Reads bytes from a file.
  - `FileOutputStream:` Writes bytes to a file.
  - `BufferedReader:` Reads text from a character input stream, buffering characters for efficient reading.
  - `BufferedWriter:` Writes text to a character output stream, buffering characters for efficient writing.

- Important Interfaces

  `Serializable:` Marks a class whose objects can be serialized (converted into a byte stream)

# Streams in Java

## What is a Stream?
A **stream** in Java represents a unidirectional flow of data. It is an abstraction that allows us to read and write data in a continuous manner. Streams can be categorized into two types based on how they handle data:

- **Byte Streams**: Handle binary data.
- **Character Streams**: Handle text data.

## Key Features of Streams
- **Unidirectional Flow**: Data flows in one direction, either input or output.
- **Efficiency**: Streams allow efficient reading and writing of data.
- **Abstraction**: They provide a simplified interface for I/O operations.

## Class Hierarchy of Java I/O Streams

The Java I/O streams are part of the `java.io` package and are organized in a class hierarchy. The primary classes include:

1. **InputStream**: An abstract class that represents an input stream of bytes. It provides methods for reading data from a source.
2. **OutputStream**: An abstract class that represents an output stream of bytes. It provides methods for writing data to a destination.
3. **Reader**: An abstract class for reading character streams. It handles text data, providing methods to read characters.
4. **Writer**: An abstract class for writing character streams. It handles text data, providing methods to write characters.

        +int read(char[] cbuf)
        +void close()
    }

    class Writer {

        +void write(char[] cbuf)
        +void close()
    }
